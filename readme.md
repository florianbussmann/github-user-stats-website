This project was made to find out what your current score is, and how close you are to your next rank!

# Ranks

- S+ (Top 1%)
- S (Top 25%)
- A++ (Top 45%)
- A+ (Top 60%)
- B+ (everyone).

The values are calculated by using the _[cumulative distribution function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function)_ using _commits, contributions, issues, stars, pull requests, followers, and owned repositories_.
The implementation can be investigated at _[src/calculateRank.js](./src/calculateRank.js)_
